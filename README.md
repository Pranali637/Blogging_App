#  Blogging App – Backend First Approach

This project is a **backend-focused blogging platform** built to understand how real-world web applications work **without relying on frontend frameworks**.

Instead of React or SPA tools, this app uses **server-side rendering with EJS**, making it simple, fast, and beginner-friendly.

Built while learning from **Piyush Garg’s Node.js backend series**.

## Why this project exists

Most beginners jump straight to React.

This project does the opposite.

It focuses on:
- How servers handle requests
- How authentication actually works
- How data flows from MongoDB → Express → EJS
- How cookies & JWTs manage login sessions
